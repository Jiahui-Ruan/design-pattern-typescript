# SOLID principles

## Single Responsibility
* Error handling code should not repeat itself in each core function
* Presentation logic code should not exist in data side
* DB/api call, file read/write should not exist in core function

## Open/Close Principle
* Open to extension
* Closed to modification

## Liskov Substitution
* Also known as substitutabilitity
* Should be able to use a subclass inplace of its parent class

# Interface Segregation
* A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement

# Dependency Inversion
*
